# project-rekt

A video game concept derived from a group project during my undergraduate years.

## High Level Vision

- Isometric grid based tower defense game set in a school environment where students are revolting en masse against the institute.
- Features placeable barriers and teacher "turrets" to fight against the student invasion over the school campus.
- Features Teamfight Tactics inspired grid movement and augments for added gameplay variance.
- Narrative is delivered through Danganronpa visual novel styled dialogue in-between stages and during stage gameplay when pinnacle scripted events occur.
- Main platforms are PC and mobile.
- Business model for this game will be a one time purchase to play forever.
