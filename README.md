# project-rekt

A video game concept derived from a group project during my undergraduate years.

## High Level Vision

- Isometric grid based tower defense game set in a school environment where students are revolting en masse against the institute.
- Features placeable barriers and teacher "turrets" to fight against the student invasion over the school campus.
- Features Teamfight Tactics inspired grid movement and augments for added gameplay variance.
- Narrative is delivered through Danganronpa visual novel styled dialogue in-between stages and during stage gameplay when pinnacle scripted events occur.
- Main platforms are PC and mobile.
- Business model for this game will be a one time purchase to play forever.

## Art Style / Theme

- User Interface Style - Sidebar and/or action bar to deploy structures and access options or game speed.

- Environments - Common school locations with classroom, library, courtyard and gym as an example.

- Characters - Generally a students/teachers with standout traits. A code monkey would be able to jump over obstacles while a law teacher will wear down students with logical arguments.

- Rendering Style - Cell shaded or stylized 3D environments and objects while characters will be 2D sprites.
